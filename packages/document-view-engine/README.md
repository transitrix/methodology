# @transitrix/document-view-engine

Parser for **skeleton files** — the Markdown-with-transclusion source format the
document-view engine renders against canon. A skeleton carries structure and
transclusion tags; the engine resolves them and emits a document. No document layout
ships with this package — a layout is authored by whoever needs that document, in
their own repository.

**Scope of this package today: syntax only.** `parseSkeleton()` turns a skeleton
file's text into a header object and a body AST. It does not resolve references
against canon, does not compute reference-resolution state, and does not render.
Those are later layers built on top of this AST.

## Skeleton file shape

```markdown
---
document: design description        # free text; the name its readers use
canon: ../canon                     # root of the model this renders against
profile: neutral                    # reserved; only `neutral` exists today
---

{{# each REQUIREMENT where level = system and kind = functional order by id }}
### {{ .id }} — {{ .title }}

{{ .text }}
{{/ each }}
```

## Syntax

Delimiters `{{ … }}`; `\{{` escapes a literal.

| Form | AST node |
|---|---|
| `{{ REQ-14 }}` | `{ type: 'inline', id, fields: [] }` |
| `{{ REQ-14.text }}` | `{ type: 'inline', id, fields: ['text'] }` |
| `{{ REQ-14.parent.title }}` | `{ type: 'inline', id, fields: ['parent', 'title'] }` — traversal capped at depth 3 |
| `{{# each TYPE where f = v and f2 != v2 order by f }} … {{/ each }}` | `{ type: 'each', entityType, where, orderBy, children }` |
| `{{ .field }}` (inside an `each` body only) | `{ type: 'field-ref', fields }` |
| `{{ trace from = A to = B via = rel }}` | `{ type: 'trace', from, to, via }` |
| `{{ view <path> as = name fit = width\|page\|none }}` | `{ type: 'view', path, as, fit }` — `as`/`fit` optional, `fit` defaults to `width` |
| `{{ figure <path> caption = "..." as = name }}` | `{ type: 'figure', path, caption, as }` — `caption`/`as` optional |
| `{{ figref <name> }}` | `{ type: 'figref', name }` |

`id` is validated against the canonical ID grammar
([`IDS_AND_REFERENCES.md`](../../notations/IDS_AND_REFERENCES.md) §1-2), including the
`CAPABILITY` V/H diagram-address exception. A `where` clause's comparison is `=` / `!=`
against a literal, ANDed only — no other operator is expressible, by design.

## Usage

```js
import { parseSkeleton } from '@transitrix/document-view-engine/src/parse-skeleton.mjs';

const { header, ast, errors } = parseSkeleton(fileText);
if (errors.length > 0) {
  // each entry is { message } — surface all of them, not just the first
}
```
