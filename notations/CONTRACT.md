# Notation contract — shared header rules

All eleven Transitrix notations share the same file-header contract: the same required field, the same reserved field, the same validator rules, and the same extension/content match guarantee. This document defines those shared rules once. Each notation spec links here and lists only its per-notation values (the `notation:` short name and the file extension).

A change to the rules below applies to all eleven notations simultaneously — they should be edited here, not duplicated into each spec.

---

## 1. Required header

Every Transitrix notation file MUST start with a header that declares which notation the file follows. The header is YAML key/value syntax at the top of the file — for YAML notations it is the document itself; for the `.blocks.transitrix.txt` notation it is the leading YAML-fenced block before the ASCII art.

```yaml
notation: <short-name>      # required; this notation's short name
spec_version: "0.1"         # optional today; reserved field; will be required when this notation reaches v1.0
# … rest of the document
```

| Field | Required | Type | Semantics |
|---|---|---|---|
| `notation` | yes | string | Short name of the notation (`bpmn`, `fgca`, `goals`, `capability-map`, …). Identifies the schema the rest of the document follows. The accepted short names are listed in [README.md](README.md). |
| `spec_version` | no, accepted | string | Declared version of the notation spec the document conforms to. Reserved today; will become required when each notation reaches v1.0. The validator accepts but does not enforce it. |

The short name is fixed per notation and matches the per-notation table at the bottom of the spec being read.

## 2. Validator behaviour

Every notation's compiler / validator enforces the same four header rules:

| Rule | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HDR-001` | error | Missing `notation` field. |
| `HDR-002` | error | `notation` value does not match the short name expected for this notation. The file is probably in the wrong format for its extension. |
| `HDR-003` | error | File extension does not match the `notation` declared inside the file (extension/content mismatch). |
| `HDR-004` | accepted | `spec_version` is accepted but not enforced until the notation reaches v1.0. |

Additional notation-specific rules (per-field, semantic, structural) live in the respective spec's "Validation rules" section.

---

## 3. Extension / content match

Each notation has exactly one canonical file extension, of the form `.<short-name>.transitrix.<ext>` where `<ext>` is `yaml` for YAML notations and `txt` for `blocks` (Svgbob ASCII). The validator rejects any file whose extension and `notation:` value disagree (rule `HDR-003`).

No aliases are accepted: one notation has exactly one extension. The full per-notation mapping lives in [README.md](README.md).
